# Track issues with Git

This repository is a placeholder for the idea of tracking issues with a Git repository for each one.

It may be expanded later to include some useful code, but for now it will just include the general ideas.


## Issue creator is owner

The person that creates an issue is the owner of the repository.

They will initially be the only one to control pull requests for updates to the issue.
